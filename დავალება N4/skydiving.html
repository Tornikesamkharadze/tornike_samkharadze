  <div class="toko"><p>So - what is skydiving? If you don't know what you're looking at, it's easy to shout the wrong thing ("Look! It's a skydiver!") whenever you see a human form toodling around in the sky under a fabric apparatus. If you want to vault over into the ranks of the savvy though, read on and we'll give you insight into just how varied the disciplines are. Skydiving isn't the only way to get around in the sky. In fact, it's part of a rather extensive family. Skydiving is one of a tradition of athletic pursuits that some call "extreme sports," some call "gravity sports," some lump in with "adventure sports" and others just call "pretty much the best way ever to spend the day." If you want to know what skydiving is, you'll need to meet the rest of the clan.The United States Parachuting Association (USPA) defines skydiving - that original "extreme sport" that precipitated the term's emergence into the cultural lexicon - as follows: 1: The descent of a person to the surface from an aircraft in flight when he or she uses or intends to use a parachute during all or part of that descent.</p></div>

  <div class="toko2"><p>2: To jump from an aircraft with a parachute. The key elements here are "aircraft" and "parachute." An "aircraft" has to be just that: a vehicle moving through the air. The aircraft doesn't have to be an airplane - it can be a hot-air balloon, a microlight, a paraglider with a tandem harness to jump from, or a big ol' dirigible. The "parachute" must be present, but it doesn't have to be of any particular kind. It can be an old-school round or a modern ram-air (square) number. These days, it's almost always the latter. Skydives are performed using a "two-parachute system," which comprises of a "container" (the backpack into which the fabric is folded) and two parachutes: the main canopy and the backup parachute (or "reserve") in case the main one malfunctions. In most skydiving systems, there's a device installed which opens the reserve parachute in the eventuality that the skydiver does not or is not able to open his/her own parachute unaided. These failsafes permit the stupendous statistical safety of tandem skydiving (which is heavily regulated).</p></div>
