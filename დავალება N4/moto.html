  <div class="toko"><p>Motocross is a motorcycle-based phenomenon that has been receiving more attention as the years have gone on - but what is it? Motocross is a racing sport where participants ride motorcycles over rough terrain. The courses have to be one to three miles long, and they need to have different obstacles for the riders. No two courses are alike, and that can make motocross more demanding than other racing sports. Whether you want to start doing motocross or want to watch, you should know what it involves. Then, you can learn what to do to win a race and how to be safe. If you prefer to watch, you can learn what to look for to see who is winning.In motocross, participants race on motorcycles, and they navigate a course with different types of terrain. If someone can ride a motorcycle on the road, they may or may not be successful in motocross. However, riding a motorcycle on any surface can make it easier to start motocross. While you may be able to hop on a motorcycle for a ride around town, preparing for a race involves a lot more than that. You have to consider how long the race is and the various obstacles you may encounter.</p></div>

  <div class="toko2"><p>Motocross is the second most physically demanding sport in the world, so it takes a lot of physical and mental training, and you may not always know what to expectduring a race. Even in Supercross, an indoor version, the course can be complicated, and track conditions are constantly changing. Here are a few factors that can affect the conditions of a motocross race:No two motocross tracks are the same, but they do have to follow some standards. International competitions must use tracks that are 1 to 3 miles (1.5 to 5 kilometers) long. Many races take less than 40 minutes for each heat, and you will have two heats in a race. Overall, a motocross race would take less than two hours to complete. The course width can also vary, but it is usually wide enough to accommodate a few racers side to side. However, the course is narrow enough to make turns somewhat difficult</p></div>
